<h1>Botium Toys' Security Audit</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a security audit that assesses the security of an organization called Botium Toys'. The audit was completed by analyzing the scope and goals that were provided by the organization. The audit began by assessing the controls that need to be implemented and ranking them from high to low priority. After the controls were assessed, a compliance checklist was used to determine what compliance laws the organization needed to follow. Finally, a stakeholder memorandum was created to inform the stakeholders and IT managers what was found in the security audit.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Overall, I think this practice case study helped me understand how to classify the importance of a control given the scope and goals of the audit. Being able to determine the organizationâ€™s needs given the scope and goals is an important skill when conducting an audit. Learning what controls corresponded to each compliance guideline was an important step in completing the stakeholder memorandum.
